* AHCI SATA Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "snps,spear-ahci"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent
- clocks            : a list of phandle + clock specifier pairs
- target-supply     : regulator for SATA target power

Example:
        sata@ffe08000 {
		compatible = "snps,spear-ahci";
		reg = <0xffe08000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <115>;

        };
